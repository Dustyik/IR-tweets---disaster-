A project by Tan Chia Yik (1003391), Tan Dao Rong, Eugene (1003442)

Installation Instructions:
Git clone the project and navigate into the "final_code_submission" directory

The GUI consists of 2 parts, a React frontend, which can be found in the "./FrontEnd" directory, and a Flask backend, which can be found in the "./Backend" directory

Navigate into the "Backend" directory, install the required python dependencies with the command $pip install -r requirements.txt
Start the backend server with the command $python server.py. Be sure to start the backend server before the frontend as the api routes needs to be ready before the front end starts.
Navigate into the "Frontend" directory, install the required node dependencies with the command $npm install. Ensure you have node.js installed beforehand
Start the frontend with the command $npm start
